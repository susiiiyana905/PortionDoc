This recipe, however, although undeniably Mediterranean in flavor, is anything but laid back. In fact, it will be in and out of your kitchen in barely any time at all—you can make it in as little as 20 minutes. All it takes is a few zaps in the microwave to warm up the stock for the couscous, followed by a little chopping for the salad and a quick sautée for the chicken.",1657264287086chickenBowl.jpg,Mediterranean Chicken Bowls,1600,Easy,Muscle Gain,"[""In a medium bowl, mix ¾ cup hot water, stock concentrate, 1 TBSP butter, and half the Mediterranean spice.

Season with salt and pepper."",""In a small bowl, stir together yogurt, juice from remaining lemon quarter, and garlic to taste. (TIP: Start with a pinch and add more from there.) Mixture should have a drizzling consistency—add up to 1 TBSP water if needed to thin. Season with salt and pepper to taste."",""Pat chicken dry with a paper towel. Season all over with turmeric, ½ tsp paprika (save the rest for the next step), salt, pepper, and remaining Mediterranean spice. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, tossing occasionally, until browned and no longer pink throughout, 4-7 minutes."",""Fluff couscous with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Divide couscous, chicken, and salad between plates. Spoon as much yogurt sauce over salad as you like. Garnish with scallion greens, a pinch of paprika, and remaining lemon zest.
